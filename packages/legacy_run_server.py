"""A server that receives and executes commands via file socket

The server expects to receive JSON arrays via a file socket. The first element in the array is the module to call.
That module must have a function with name `main`. That function is called with the remaining array elements as
parameter.

Thanks to the server running continuously this means that python code can be executed without bootstrapping the python
environment first.

    The function uses the F_NOTIFY Linux kernel feature to receive a notification if a file in the directory where
    openwb.conf is stored changes.

    However the linux kernel is very fast in sending notifications. If a process changes a file it is likely that the
    file is changed in multiple write operations that all happen within a few milliseconds. In this case we also receive
    multiple notifications. Thus we cannot tell if the process modifying our file has finished updating the file (best
    would be to use file locks, but openWB does not use file locks. It would require changes at a vast number of
    places).

    To workaround the issue we simply wait 200ms after a change was detected. If within these 200ms another change is
    detected, the timer is reset. If there has not been any notification for 200ms we assume that there are no pending
    updates.
